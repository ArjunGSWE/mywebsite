            <p>
                Hello! I'm Arjun G, a passionate and dedicated software engineer and a student
                in Thiruvarur, Tamil Nadu, India. I have a keen interest in Full Stack Development and Machine Learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy working on full stack development, data analysis projects, collaborative coding sessions and I'm always eager to learn new things
                and take on challenging opportunities. This portfolio is a space where I showcase my projects, skills, and share a bit
                more about my journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore my work and get in touch if you'd like to connect, collaborate, or learn more!
